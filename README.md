## Capstone Project with APL Logistics, Arizona

### <ins>Master's Capstone Project</ins>: *"Predicting Shipping Time/Transit Time to show â€‹ETA/ETD for shipments using Machine Learning models"* <br>

_Key Skills: Python (Pandas, Numpy, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Neural Nets), Third Party Supply Chain Logistics_

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am led a comprehensive end-to-end project along with 4 graduates, culminating in a Streamlit app to forecast ETA/ETD for ocean shipments, enhancing supply chain visibility.<br>
Key achievements till now:
<li> 
<ul>Analyzed data from 3 customers, covering 54k shipments and 211 routes.</ul>
Enhanced the predictive model with static (e.g., holidays) and dynamic factors (e.g., port congestion, weather disruptions).
Conducted EDA using Tableau, evaluating 23 carriers across various routes.
Developed a machine learning model (employing algorithms such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, MLR, and Neural Networks) with an R2 score of 0.78, demonstrating high predictive accuracy.
Successfully deployed a Streamlit application showcasing the model's capability to predict shipment times accurately, improving operational efficiency in logistics.
